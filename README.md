************** NOTES ****************
rfce            creates base react function

for fontawesome icons when you import {fa<iconname>} from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons', you can see
that on different icons it'll have icon="fa-brands fa-instagram" for example so you'll have to replace free-solid with
free-brands (for social media icons) and etc.
